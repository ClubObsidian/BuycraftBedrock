# BuycraftBedrock

BuycraftBedrock is a fork of the [BuycraftX](https://github.com/tebexio/BuycraftX) plugin that supports bedrock.

## Fork Details

BuycraftBedrock only support Bukkit based servers that have bedrock support via something like [Geyser](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser). This works by translating the xuid to a Java uuid. You will also need BuycraftX installed if you want to support Java players.

## Setup

1. Install the plugin for your relevant version
2. Make an online bedrock store
3. Follow the normal [BuycraftX](https://github.com/tebexio/BuycraftX) install instructions to setup the store.

**PLEASE NOTE** you will still need a Java store as well if you want to support Java edition users, this will only support bedrock edition users.
